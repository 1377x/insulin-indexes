# insulin-indexes
Mi first creation

Hi stranger
This is a HOMA-IR, HOMA-Beta, QUICKI, SPINA-GR, SPINA-GBETA
-Can be calculated from glucose in mg/dL and mmol/L
-The insulin value must be in IU/mL
-For now, does not have graphical interface
-if you only have glucose in mg/dL or mmol/L, put 0 on the another
